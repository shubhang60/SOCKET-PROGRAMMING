# c++ program
#3.C++ program to perform bit stuffing on the following data stream at the sender end and then perform the bit unstuffing at the receiver end to retrieve the original data.
Data stream: 10101111111101011111111111110000011100011111111100

#4. i) Write a C or C++ program to perform bit stuffing on the following data
stream at the sender end and then perform the bit unstuffing at the receiver
end to retrieve the original data.
Data stream: 10101111111101011111111111110000011100011111111100
   
    ii)Write a C or C++ program to perform the byte stuffing and unstuffing of the
    following data stream represented in Hexadecimal form. The hexadecimal
    code for the flag and escape are 0x7F 0x5D (here 0x means that the data is
    represented in hexadecimal form). Note that the flag and escape code
    appearing within the data frame have to be escaped using the escape code.
    Hexadecimal data stream: 0x6A912EEF7F125DB217F1A85D12F
    (Flag and ESC code are highlighted in red color)
